kivy-test
=========

Trying out plotting widgets in kivy for use in visualizing simulation
results.  The plotter must be able to change data as parameters in the 
simulation are adjusted, and to show different simulation runs.  Also
of interest are sliders for selecting a parameter range, rather than
a particular value.
